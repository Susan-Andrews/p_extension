                <p id="intro" class="text-justify pb-5 pt-3">Dive into my portfolio website to know more about me! I
                    have unveiled my passion and expertise in
                    building the projects, especially when it comes to building this one. The <strong>Home section</strong>  leads you to
                    the
                    About section and Contact section if you want to ping me. The <strong>Projects section</strong> describes a curated
                    collection of projects, each represents a piece of the journey and problem-solving. The <strong>Blog section</strong>
                    is
                    my favorite part of this website which leads to my personal blog site.</p>
                    <p id="end" class="text-justify pb-5 ">From structuring the site using HTML and giving functionalities
                        using JavaScript, I have spent
                        hours and hours rectifying minute errors. Of course, the website has its own limitations and
                        disadvantages, but it reveals the dedication towards work and consistency in building my resume.
                        This
                        not only validates my skills but motivates me to push the boundaries of what's possible.

                    <p id="tech" class="text-justify pb-5 ">The backbone of this portfolio is built on the solid foundation
                    of <strong>HTML</strong> for structure, <strong>CSS</strong> for
                    style, and
                    <strong>JavaScript</strong> for interactivity. Together, they create a responsive and user-friendly interface. By
                    adding
                    the power of <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, I have implemented the mobile-first approach, ensuring that your experience
                    is
                    smooth and consistent across devices of all sizes. It is super responsive for all viewports. I have
                    added the link for my blog app called Taillight which is built using the JavaScript framework called
                    Angular. The blog section is a dynamic addition powered by Angular. This single-page application
                    (SPA)
                    not only enhances the user experience but also showcases my proficiency in building robust and
                    interactive web applications.</p>

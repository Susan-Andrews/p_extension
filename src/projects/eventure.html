                    EVenture was a 2-day technical conclave organized by the Industry Applications Society Chapter of
                    IEEE SB AJCE in collaboration with IEEE IA/IE/PELS Jt. Chapter Kerala. The conclave brings together
                    electric vehicle enthusiasts, industry experts, and students to discuss and learn about the latest
                    trends and innovations in the electric vehicle industry.The event featured a variety of engaging
                    activities, including a panel discussion, EV Entrepreneurship Pitch Competition, Keynote Speech/EV
                    Showcase, Treasure Hunt Game, Cultural Events, Network Session, Basic Workshop for School Students,
                    JAM (Just a Minute), and Workshop on EV Battery Design Using MATLAB and EV Technologies.

                    As a collaborative effort within the IEEE AJCE SB Web coordination team, I had the privilege of
                    contributing to the EVenture website development. Our dedicated team worked cohesively to
                    successfully complete and host the website, introducing the event, outlining the conducted programs,
                    and providing a seamless registration facility.

                    In crafting the EVenture website, we meticulously blended HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a
                    digital masterpiece. The seamless fusion of these technologies resulted in a website with a flawless
                    layout, perfectly harmonizing with the theme and essence of EVenture â€“ the electric vehicle
                    conclave. Instead of merely listing the technology stacks employed, the website effortlessly
                    radiates its own perfection, eloquently capturing the spirit and sophistication of the event.

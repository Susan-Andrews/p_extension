                    Medminder is a pill reminder app designed to help users stay on track with their medication
                    schedule. The app sends
                    reminders to the user at the appropriate times, reminding them to take their medication according to
                    the schedule with
                    the help of a voice assistant. By using the app, users can reduce the risk of missed doses, which
                    can lead to
                    complications and treatment failure. On the other hand, it also helps the patient's bystanders or
                    caretakers, especially
                    in the case of aged and small children, to get notified whether they have taken the medicine or not.

                    In the <strong>collaborative</strong> team effort of four, I took a lead role in shaping the user interface for
                    Medminder, contributing significantly to its visual appeal and usability. My responsibilities
                    included conceptualizing and implementing key UI elements, ensuring an intuitive and engaging
                    experience. With a focus on user-centric design, my contributions played a central role in
                    transforming functional requirements into a seamless interface. The success of Medminder reflects
                    our collective efforts, where my emphasis on UI design contributed to creating a visually compelling
                    and user-friendly pill reminder application.

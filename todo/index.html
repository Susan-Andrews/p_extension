                    Todo App is a dynamic React application designed for efficiently managing daily tasks and to-do
                    lists. Users can effortlessly schedule, organize, and prioritize their activities with the seamless
                    features offered. This intuitive app empowers users to add new tasks, mark them as completed, and

                    Todo App stands as my inaugural venture into React application development, serving as a pivotal
                    component of my internship project. This enriching internship experience was provided by
                    Startups Valley TBI (Technology Incubator Innovation) at our college. It not only provided a
                    foundational understanding of web development but also extended the learning curve into the realm of
                    React.During the internship sessions, I delved into the basics of web development, and the acquired
                    knowledge seamlessly evolved into hands-on experience with React. The Todo App project serves as a
                    tangible representation of the key concepts gleaned from these enlightening internship classes.

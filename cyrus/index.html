                    Embarking on the journey of Cyrus Motorsports AJCE marks my <strong>first team endeavor</strong>, a project where I
                    contributed alongside passionate peers in the pursuit of excellence. This project helped to learn
                    and master the art of teamwork and collaboration, in order to become successful in team dynamics.

                    In the dynamic world of web development, we've harnessed the power of <strong>HTML</strong> , <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, and
                    <strong>JavaScript</strong> to craft an immersive online experience. HTML forms the structural framework, CSS adds
                    aesthetic flair, Bootstrap ensures responsiveness across devices, and JavaScript injects
                    interactivity, creating a digital track where enthusiasts can explore our race towards excellence.
